# Phonebook-System
   The aim of this project is to develop a simple and interactive PhoneBook Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. The system will allow users to manage contact information by performing basic operations such as adding, searching, displaying, and deleting contacts through a console-based interface.
The main problem addressed by this project is the lack of a lightweight, beginner-friendly contact management tool that can be used for educational and practical purposes. While contact management is a common feature in mobile and web applications, those solutions are often too complex for beginners to understand or modify. This project provides a minimal, easy-to-understand alternative that can run in a console environment without any external dependencies.
The significance of this project lies in its educational value and real-world relevance. It allows students to apply core OOP concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design while building a functional application. It also offers a strong foundation for future improvements, such as file handling, contact editing, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
